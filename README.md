# A2 Discord Bot - Improvements

This improvements branch allows for multiple improvements without ruining the actual old nostalgic vibe of the original bot.

This bot is a recreation of the Orion Drift A2 bot that used to serve information about the current players online in each fleet.

## Setup

Basically you can either use the docker image

avery442love/a2-discord-bot:improve

or you can start it on windows, mac and linux using the start.bat and start.sh scripts. Make sure to modify them to have your required variables set.
